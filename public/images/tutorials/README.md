# Tutorial Images

This directory contains placeholder images for the tutorial sections. In a production environment, these would be replaced with actual screenshots or illustrations showing the steps for each tutorial.

## Image Naming Convention

Images follow this naming pattern:
- `{tutorial-id}-step{step-number}-{language}.jpg`

For example:
- `complaint-step1-en.jpg` - First step of the complaint tutorial in English
- `chatbot-step3-hi.jpg` - Third step of the chatbot tutorial in Hindi
